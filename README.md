# Investment Calculator React Project

This project is a simple investment calculator that allows the user to enter an initial investment amount, a monthly contribution amount, an annual interest rate, and a number of years to invest. The calculator will then display the future value of the investment. It is part of the React course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.
